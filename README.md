# pipenv-example-basic
* **Note: This example is performed on a Windows OS system and uses PowerShell.**
* This example repository will guide user through installing `pipenv` and creating a `pipenv` virtual environment. The virtual environment will not have any project specific packages installed. After finishing this process, the user should ensure the current terminal session is in same directory where `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` are located and then use `pipenv install PACKAGE` or `pipenv install PACKAGE==VERSION` to install needed packages.
